Plain Warp was a attempt to see which are the most reduced OS/2 Warp 4.52 can be runned on a Virtual Machine. 

The goal was to run OS/2.
- Boot the OS
- Run the basic WPS
- Mouse and Keyboard support.

This OS/2 is very useless, but this was only a test to see which are the files that are required for OS/2 to boot.

Since part of my goal is also to one day have a complete OS/2 Warp clone I had marked the files that can be replaced, or that already a replacement had been created. 

- Green: Replacement Available
- Yellow: Possible replacement available.
- No color: No replacement known.
